    This paper focuses on computing the convex conjugate operation that
    arises when solving Euclidean Wasserstein-2 optimal transport
    problems. This conjugation, which is also referred to as the
    Legendre-Fenchel conjugate or c-transform,is considered difficult to
    compute and in practice,Wasserstein-2 methods are limited by not being
    able to exactly conjugate the dual potentials in continuous space. To
    overcome this, the computation of the conjugate can be approximated
    with amortized optimization, which learns a model to predict the
    conjugate. I show that combining amortized approximations to the
    conjugate with a solver for fine-tuning significantly improves the
    quality of transport maps learned for the Wasserstein-2 benchmark by
    Korotin et al. (2021a) and is able to model many 2-dimensional
    couplings and flows considered in the literature.
