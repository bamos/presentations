  We investigate the optimal transport problem between probability
  measures when the underlying cost function is understood to satisfy a
  least action principle, also known as a Lagrangian cost. These
  generalizations are useful when connecting observations from a
  physical system where the transport dynamics are influenced by the
  geometry of the system, such as obstacles (e.g., incorporating barrier
  functions in the Lagrangian), and allows practitioners to incorporate
  a priori knowledge of the underlying system such as non-Euclidean
  geometries (e.g., paths must be circular). Our contributions are of
  computational interest, where we demonstrate the ability to
  efficiently compute geodesics and amortize spline-based paths, which
  has not been done before, even in low dimensional problems. Unlike
  prior work, we also output the resulting Lagrangian optimal transport
  map without requiring an ODE solver. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our formulation on low-dimensional examples taken from prior work.
